Insight: Perceptual Hashing Engine
=======

Insight is a simple perceptual hashing engine that enables fuzzy image comparison through the estimation of visual similarity. This system detects structural similarities and is invariant to scale and rotation, so it is particularly useful for certain kinds of tasks including:

* Reverse image search
* Pose estimation
* Data forensics
* Image reconstruction

This is accomplished by generating a pair of digital fingerprints of two files in a manner that is resiliant to minor changes. These fingerprints can then be compared in order to form an estimate of similarity.
