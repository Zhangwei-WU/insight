// Description:
//
//   Vision is a foundation of basic types, data structures, and utiliy functions. 
//
//   Although Insight leverages Vision, it is not fully included in this source 
//   release. Instead, we've provided a compact version that provides only the minimal
//   functionality required for Insight. To download the full version of Vision (which 
//   is not required for Insight), visit the website below.
